2. Server Traffic Monitor
There is client-server architecture with n clients and one server. Each client starts its interaction with the server at the second start[i] and stops at the second end[i]. The maximum traffic is defined as the maximum number of concurrent interactions with the server.

 

Find the earliest time at which the maximum number of clients are interacting with the server.



Note: The endpoint is also included in the interaction.

 

Example

Suppose start = [1, 6, 2 ,9] and end = [8, 7, 6, 10]


Time	Connection	Active Clients
1	Client 1 Joined	1
2	Client 3 Joined	1, 3
3	 	1, 3
4	 	1, 3
5	 	1, 3
6	Client 2 Joined	1, 2, 3
7	Client 3 Left	1, 2
8	Client 2 Left	1
9	Client 1 Left and Client 4 Joined	4
10	 	4
11	Client 4 Left	 

The maximum number of concurrent interactions is 3 which happens first at the 6th second. Return 6.

 

Function Description 

Complete the function getMaxTrafficTime in the editor below.

 

getMaxTrafficTime has the following parameters:

    int start[n]:  interaction start times

    int end[n]:  interaction end times

 

Returns

    int:  the earliest time of maximum concurrent interactions

 

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ start[i] ≤ end[i] ≤ 109

The first line contains an integer n, the number of clients.

Each of the next n lines contains an integer start[i].

The next line contains the same integer n, the number of clients.

Each of the next n lines contains an integer end[i].

4
Explanation

At time t = 4, the first, second, and fourth clients are connected to the server. At time t = 7, the last three clients are connected.

 

The earliest time when 3 are connected is t = 4.
